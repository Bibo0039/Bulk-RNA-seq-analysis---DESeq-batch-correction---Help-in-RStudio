# DESeq & batch-correction in RStudio
Help in RStudio about Bulk-RNA-seq-analysis needed.

## Experiment
- RNA analysis of several groups: ctrl, treatment 1 (t1), treatment 2 (t2), treatment 3 (t3)
- comparison of t1 vs ctrl, t2 vs ctrl, t3 vs ctrl

## Question 1
1 DESeq for all comparisons? If yes, what do I include in the design?
or a sepearte DESeq for every comparison and include the treatment in the design?

## Question 2
what is going wrong in my sva batch correction? Is there a better way?
