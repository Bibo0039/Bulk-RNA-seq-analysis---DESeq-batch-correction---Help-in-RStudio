# Bulk-RNA-seq-analysis---DESeq-batch-correction---Help-in-RStudio

# experiment:
## RNA analysis of several groups: ctrl, treatment 1 (t1), treatment 2 (t2), treatment 3 (t3)
## comparison of t1 vs ctrl, t2 vs ctrl, t3 vs ctrl

# question 1
## 1 DESeq for all comparisons? If yes, what do I include in the design?
## or a sepearte DESeq for every comparison and include the treatment in the design?

# question 2
## what is going wrong in my sva batch correction? Is there a better way?
